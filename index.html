            Three-body problem
          </a>
        </h1>
        <p>
          In physics and classical mechanics, the three-body problem is the problem of
          taking the initial positions and velocities (or momenta) of three point masses
          and solving for their subsequent motion according to Newton's laws of motion
          and Newton's law of universal gravitation.[1] The three-body problem is a
          special case of the n-body problem. Unlike two-body problems, no general
          closed-form solution exists,[1] as the resulting dynamical system is chaotic
          for most initial conditions, and numerical methods are generally required.
        </p>
        <p>
          Historically, the first specific three-body problem to receive extended study
          was the one involving the Moon, Earth, and the Sun.[2] In an extended modern
          sense, a three-body problem is any problem in classical mechanics or quantum
          mechanics that models the motion of three particles.

          Mathematical description
        </h2>
        <p>
          The mathematical statement of the three-body problem can be given in terms of
          the Newtonian equations of motion for vector positions r = (x, y, z) of three
          gravitationally interacting bodies with masses m:
          <div class="eq">
            \begin{aligned}
            {\ddot {\mathbf {r} }}_{\mathbf {1} } & = -Gm_{2}{\frac {\mathbf {r_{1}} -\mathbf {r_{2}} }{|\mathbf {r_{1}}
            -\mathbf {r_{2}} |^{3}}}-Gm_{3}{\frac {\mathbf {r_{1}} -\mathbf {r_{3}} }{|\mathbf {r_{1}} -\mathbf {r_{3}} |^{3}}}, \\
            {\ddot {\mathbf {r} }}_{\mathbf {2} } & = -Gm_{3}{\frac {\mathbf {r_{2}} -\mathbf {r_{3}} }{|\mathbf {r_{2}}
            -\mathbf {r_{3}} |^{3}}}-Gm_{1}{\frac {\mathbf {r_{2}} -\mathbf {r_{1}} }{|\mathbf {r_{2}} -\mathbf {r_{1}} |^{3}}}, \\
            {\ddot {\mathbf {r} }}_{\mathbf {3} } & = -Gm_{1}{\frac {\mathbf {r_{3}} -\mathbf {r_{1}} }{|\mathbf {r_{3}}
            -\mathbf {r_{1}} |^{3}}}-Gm_{2}{\frac {\mathbf {r_{3}} -\mathbf {r_{2}} }{|\mathbf {r_{3}} -\mathbf {r_{2}} |^{3}}}.
            \end{aligned}
          </div>
          where G is the gravitational constant.[3][4] This is a set of nine second-order
          differential equations. The problem can also be stated equivalently in the
          Hamiltonian formalism, in which case it is described by a set of 18 first-order
          differential equations, one for each component of the positions r and momenta p:
          <div class="eq">
            \frac{d\mathbf{r}_i}{dt} = \frac{\partial{\mathcal{H}}}{\partial\mathbf{p}_i},\quad
            \frac{d\mathbf{p}_i}{dt} = -\frac{\partial{\mathcal{H}}}{\partial\mathbf{r}_i}
          </div>
          where H is the Hamiltonian:
          <div class="eq">
            \mathcal{H} = -\frac{Gm_1m_2}{|\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2|} - \frac{Gm_2m_3}{|\mathbf{r}_3 - \mathbf{r}_2|} -
            \frac{Gm_3m_1}{|\mathbf{r}_3 - \mathbf{r}_1|} + \frac{\mathbf{p}_1^2}{2m_1} + \frac{\mathbf{p}_2^2}{2m_2} +
            \frac{\mathbf{p}_3^2}{2m_3}
          </div>
          In this case H is simply the total energy of the system, gravitational
          plus kinetic.

          Restricted three-body problem
        </h2>
        <p>
          In the restricted three-body problem, a body of negligible mass (the "planetoid")
          moves under the influence of two massive bodies. Having negligible mass, the
          force that the planetoid exerts on the two massive bodies may be neglected, and
          the system can be analysed and can therefore be described in terms of a two-body
          motion.[3][5] With respect to a rotating reference frame, the two co-orbiting
          bodies are stationary, and the third can be stationary as well at the Lagrangian
          points, or move around them, for instance on a horseshoe orbit. It can be useful
          to consider the effective potential. Usually this two-body motion is taken to
          consist of circular orbits around the center of mass, and the planetoid is
          assumed to move in the plane defined by the circular orbits.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          The restricted three-body problem is easier to analyze theoretically than the
          full problem. It is of practical interest as well since it accurately describes
          many real-world problems, the most important example being the Earth–Moon–Sun
          system. For these reasons, it has occupied an important role in the historical
          development of the three-body problem.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Mathematically, the problem is stated as follows.[according to whom?] Let
          m<small>1,2</small>  be the masses of the two massive bodies, with (planar)
          coordinates (x<small>1</small>, y<small>1</small>) and (x<small>2</small>,
          y<small>2</small>), and let (x, y) be the coordinates of the planetoid. For
          simplicity, choose units such that the distance between the two massive bodies,
          as well as the gravitational constant, are both equal to 1. Then, the motion of
          the planetoid is given by
          <div class="eq">
            \begin{aligned}
            {\frac {d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}} & = -m_{1}{\frac {x-x_{1}}{r_{1}^{3}}}-m_{2}{\frac {x-x_{2}}{r_{2}^{3}}}, \\
            {\frac {d^{2}y}{dt^{2}}} & = -m_{1}{\frac {y-y_{1}}{r_{1}^{3}}}-m_{2}{\frac {y-y_{2}}{r_{2}^{3}}},
            \end{aligned}
          </div>
          where <span class="eq">r_{i} = \sqrt{{(x - x_{i})^2 + (y - y_{i})^2}}</span>
          In this form the equations of motion carry an explicit time dependence
          through the coordinates x(t),y(t). However, this time dependence can be removed through a
          transformation to a rotating reference frame, which simplifies any subsequent
          analysis.

        <h2>
          General solution
        </h2>
        <p>
          There is no general closed-form solution to the three-body problem,[1] meaning
          there is no general solution that can be expressed in terms of a finite number of
          standard mathematical operations. Moreover, the motion of three bodies is
          generally non-repeating, except in special cases.[6]
        </p>
        <p>
          However, in 1912 the Finnish mathematician Karl Fritiof Sundman proved that there
          exists an analytic solution to the three-body problem in the form of a power
          series in terms of powers of t<sup>1/3</sup>.[7] This series converges for all
          real t, except for initial conditions corresponding to zero angular momentum. In
          practice, the latter restriction is insignificant since initial conditions with
          zero angular momentum are rare, having Lebesgue measure zero.
        </p>
        <p>
          An important issue in proving this result is the fact that the radius of
          convergence for this series is determined by the distance to the nearest
          singularity. Therefore, it is necessary to study the possible singularities of
          the three-body problems. As is briefly discussed below, the only singularities in
          the three-body problem are binary collisions (collisions between two particles at
          an instant) and triple collisions (collisions between three particles at an
          instant).
        </p>
        <p>
          Collisions, whether binary or triple (in fact, any number), are somewhat
          improbable, since it has been shown that they correspond to a set of initial
          conditions of measure zero. However, there is no criterion known to be put on the
          initial state in order to avoid collisions for the corresponding solution. So
          Sundman's strategy consisted of the following steps:<br /><br />
        <ol>
          <li>
            Using an appropriate change of variables to continue analyzing the
            solution beyond the binary collision, in a process known as regularization.
          </li>
          <li>
            Proving that triple collisions only occur when the angular momentum L
            vanishes. By restricting the initial data to L ≠ 0, he removed all real
            singularities from the transformed equations for the three-body problem.
          </li>
          <li>
            Showing that if L ≠ 0, then not only can there be no triple collision,
            but the system is strictly bounded away from a triple collision. This
            implies, by using Cauchy's existence theorem for differential equations, that
            there are no complex singularities in a strip (depending on the value of L)
            in the complex plane centered around the real axis (shades of Kovalevskaya).
          </li>
          <li>
            Find a conformal transformation that maps this strip into the unit disc.
            For example, if s = t<sup>1/3</sup> (the new variable after the regularization)
            and if |ln s| ≤ β,[clarification needed] then this map is given by
            <span class="eq">\sigma = \frac{{e^{\frac{\pi s}{2\beta}} - 1}}{{e^{\frac{\pi s}{2\beta}} + 1}}</span>
          </li>
          </ol>
          <br /><br />
          This finishes the proof of Sundman's theorem.
        </p>
        <p>
          The corresponding series, however, converges very slowly. That is, obtaining a
          value of meaningful precision requires so many terms that this solution is of
          little practical use. Indeed, in 1930, David Beloriszky calculated that if
          Sundman's series were to be used for astronomical observations, then the
          computations would involve at least 10<sup>8000000</sup> terms.[8]

          Special-case solutions
        </h2>
        <p>
          In 1767, Leonhard Euler found three families of periodic solutions in which the
          three masses are collinear at each instant. See Euler's three-body problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1772, Lagrange found a family of solutions in which the three masses form an
          equilateral triangle at each instant. Together with Euler's collinear solutions,
          these solutions form the central configurations for the three-body problem. These
          solutions are valid for any mass ratios, and the masses move on Keplerian
          ellipses. These four families are the only known solutions for which there are
          explicit analytic formulae. In the special case of the circular restricted three-
          body problem, these solutions, viewed in a frame rotating with the primaries,
          become points referred to as L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5, and called Lagrangian
          points, with L4 and L5 being symmetric instances of Lagrange's solution.
          </p>
        <p>
          In work summarized in 1892–1899, Henri Poincaré established the existence of an
          infinite number of periodic solutions to the restricted three-body problem,
          together with techniques for continuing these solutions into the general three-
          body problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1893, Meissel stated what is now called the Pythagorean three-body problem:
          three masses in the ratio 3:4:5 are placed at rest at the vertices of a 3:4:5
          right triangle. Burrau[9] further investigated this problem in 1913. In 1967
          Victor Szebehely and C. Frederick Peters established eventual escape for this
          problem using numerical integration, while at the same time finding a nearby p
          eriodic solution.[10]
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 1970s, Michel Hénon and Roger A. Broucke each found a set of solutions
          that form part of the same family of solutions: the Broucke–Henon–Hadjidemetriou
          family. In this family the three objects all have the same mass and can exhibit
          both retrograde and direct forms. In some of Broucke's solutions two of the
          bodies follow the same path.[12]
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1993, a zero angular momentum solution with three equal masses moving around a
          figure-eight shape was discovered numerically by physicist Cris Moore at the
          Santa Fe Institute.[13] Its formal existence was later proved in 2000 by
          mathematicians Alain Chenciner and Richard Montgomery.[14][15] The solution has
          been shown numerically to be stable for small perturbations of the mass and
          orbital parameters, which makes it possible that such orbits could be observed in
          the physical universe. However, it has been argued that this occurrence is
          unlikely since the domain of stability is small. For instance, the probability of
          a binary–binary scattering event[clarification needed] resulting in a figure-8
          orbit has been estimated to be a small fraction of a percent.[16]
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2013, physicists Milovan Šuvakov and Veljko Dmitrašinović at the Institute of
          Physics in Belgrade discovered 13 new families of solutions for the equal-mass
          zero-angular-momentum three-body problem.[6][12]
          </p>
        <p>
          In 2015, physicist Ana Hudomal discovered 14 new families of solutions for the
          equal-mass zero-angular-momentum three-body problem.[17]
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2017, researchers Xiaoming Li and Shijun Liao found 669 new periodic orbits of
          the equal-mass zero-angular-momentum three-body problem.[18] This was followed in
          2018 by an additional 1223 new solutions for a zero-angular-momentum system of
          unequal masses.[19]
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2018, Li and Liao reported 234 solutions to the unequal-mass "free-fall"
          three-body problem.[20] The free fall formulation of the three body problem
          starts with all three bodies at rest. Because of this, the masses in a free-fall
          configuration do not orbit in a closed "loop", but travel forward and backward
          along an open "track".
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2023, Ivan Hristov, Radoslava Hristova, Dmitrašinović and Kiyotaka Tanikawa
          published a search for "periodic free-fall orbits" three-body problem, limited to
          the equal-mass case, in which they found 12,409 distinct solutions.[21]

          History
        </h2>
        <p>
          The gravitational problem of three bodies in its traditional sense dates in
          substance from 1687, when Isaac Newton published his Philosophiæ Naturalis
          Principia Mathematica, when Newton was trying to figure out if any long term
          stability is possible, especially the system of our Earth, the Moon, and the Sun.
          He was guided under the major Renaissance astronomers Nicolaus Copernicus, Tycho
          Brahe and Johannes Kepler to the beginning of the gravitational three-body
          problem.[25] In Proposition 66 of Book 1 of the Principia, and its 22
          Corollaries, Newton took the first steps in the definition and study of the
          problem of the movements of three massive bodies subject to their mutually
          perturbing gravitational attractions. In Propositions 25 to 35 of Book 3, Newton
          also took the first steps in applying his results of Proposition 66 to the lunar
          theory, the motion of the Moon under the gravitational influence of Earth and the
          Sun.[26] Later, this problem was also applied to other planets' interactions with
          the Earth and the Sun.[25]
        </p>
        <p>
          The physical problem was first addressed by Amerigo Vespucci and subsequently by
          Galileo Galilei, as well as Simon Stevin, but they did not realize what they
          contributed. Though Galileo determined that the speed of fall of all bodies
          changes uniformly and in the same way, he did not apply it to planetary motions.
          [25] Whereas in 1499, Vespucci used knowledge of the position of the Moon to
          determine his position in Brazil.[27] It became of technical importance in the
          1720s, as an accurate solution would be applicable to navigation, specifically
          for the determination of longitude at sea, solved in practice by John Harrison's
          invention of the marine chronometer. However the accuracy of the lunar theory was
          low, due to the perturbing effect of the Sun and planets on the motion of the
          Moon around Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jean le Rond d'Alembert and Alexis Clairaut, who developed a longstanding
          rivalry, both attempted to analyze the problem in some degree of generality; they
          submitted their competing first analyses to the Académie Royale des Sciences in
          1747.[28] It was in connection with their research, in Paris during the 1740s,
          that the name "three-body problem" (French: Problème des trois Corps) began to be
          commonly used. An account published in 1761 by Jean le Rond d'Alembert indicates
          that the name was first used in 1747.[29]
        </p>
        <p>
          From the end of the 19th century to early 20th century, the approach to solve the
          three-body problem with the usage of short-range attractive two-body forces was
          developed by scientists, which offered P.F. Bedaque, H.-W. Hammer and U. van
          Kolck an idea to renormalize the short-range three-body problem, providing
          scientists a rare example of a renormalization group limit cycle at the beginning
          of the 21st century.[30] George William Hill worked on the restricted problem in
          the late 19th century with an application of motion of Venus and Mercury.[31]
        </p>
        <p>
          At the beginning of the 20th century, Karl Sundman approached the problem
          mathematically and systematically by providing a function theoretical proof to
          the problem valid for all values of time. It was the first time scientists
          theoretically solved three-body problem. However, because there was not enough
          qualitative solution of this system, and it was too slow for scientists to
          practically apply it, this solution still left some issues unresolved.[32] In the
          1970s, implication to three-body from two-body forces had been discovered by V.
          Efimov, which was named as Efimov Effect.[33]

        <p>
          In 2017, Shijun Liao and Xiaoming Li applied a new strategy of numerical
          simulation for chaotic systems called the clean numerical simulation (CNS), with
          the use of a national supercomputer, to successfully gain 695 families of
          periodic solutions of the three-body system with equal mass.[34]

          In 2019, Breen et al. announced a fast neural network solver for the three-body
          problem, trained using a numerical integrator.[35]
        </p>
        <p>

          Other problems involving three bodies
        </h2>
        <p>
          The term "three-body problem" is sometimes used in the more general sense to
          refer to any physical problem involving the interaction of three bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          A quantum-mechanical analogue of the gravitational three-body problem in
          classical mechanics is the helium atom, in which a helium nucleus and two
          electrons interact according to the inverse-square Coulomb interaction. Like the
          gravitational three-body problem, the helium atom cannot be solved exactly.[38]
        </p>
        <p>
          In both classical and quantum mechanics, however, there exist nontrivial
          interaction laws besides the inverse-square force that do lead to exact analytic
          three-body solutions. One such model consists of a combination of harmonic
          attraction and a repulsive inverse-cube force.[39] This model is considered
          nontrivial since it is associated with a set of nonlinear differential equations
          containing singularities (compared with, e.g., harmonic interactions alone, which
          lead to an easily solved system of linear differential equations). In these two
          respects it is analogous to (insoluble) models having Coulomb interactions, and
          as a result has been suggested as a tool for intuitively understanding physical
          systems like the helium atom.[39][40]
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the point vortex model, the motion of vortices in a two-dimensional ideal
          fluid is described by equations of motion that contain only first-order time
          derivatives. I.e. in contrast to Newtonian mechanics, it is the velocity and not
          the acceleration that is determined by their relative positions. As a
          consequence, the three-vortex problem is still integrable,[41] while at least
          four vortices are required to obtain chaotic behavior.[42] One can draw parallels
          between the motion of a passive tracer particle in the velocity field of three
          vortices and the restricted three-body problem of Newtonian mechanics.[43]
        </p>
        <p>
          The gravitational three-body problem has also been studied using general
          relativity. Physically, a relativistic treatment becomes necessary in systems
          with very strong gravitational fields, such as near the event horizon of a black
          hole. However, the relativistic problem is considerably more difficult than in
          Newtonian mechanics, and sophisticated numerical techniques are required. Even
          the full two-body problem (i.e. for arbitrary ratio of masses) does not have a
          rigorous analytic solution in general relativity.[44]

          n-body problem
        </h2>
        <p>
          The three-body problem is a special case of the n-body problem, which describes
          how n objects move under one of the physical forces, such as gravity. These
          problems have a global analytical solution in the form of a convergent power
          series, as was proven by Karl F. Sundman for n = 3 and by Qiudong Wang for n > 3
          (see n-body problem for details). However, the Sundman and Wang series converge
          so slowly that they are useless for practical purposes;[45] therefore, it is
          currently necessary to approximate solutions by numerical analysis in the form of
          numerical integration or, for some cases, classical trigonometric series
          approximations (see n-body simulation). Atomic systems, e.g. atoms, ions, and
          molecules, can be treated in terms of the quantum n-body problem. Among classical
          physical systems, the n-body problem usually refers to a galaxy or to a cluster
          of galaxies; planetary systems, such as stars, planets, and their satellites, can
          also be treated as n-body systems. Some applications are conveniently treated by
          perturbation theory, in which the system is considered as a two-body problem plus
          additional forces causing deviations from a hypothetical unperturbed two-body
          trajectory.

          In the classic 1951 science-fiction film The Day the Earth Stood Still, the alien
          Klaatu, using the pseudonym Mr. Carpenter, makes some annotations to equations on
          Prof. Barnhardt's blackboard. Those equations are an accurate description of a
          particular form of the three-body problem.

          The first volume of Chinese author Liu Cixin's Remembrance of Earth's Past
          trilogy is titled The Three-Body Problem and features the three-body problem as a
          central plot device.[46]

            The 1747 memoirs of both parties can be read in the volume of Histoires
            (including Mémoires) of the Académie Royale des Sciences for 1745 (belatedly
            published in Paris in 1749) (in French):
            Clairaut: "On the System of the World, according to the principles of Universal
            Gravitation" (at pp. 329–364); and d'Alembert: "General method for determining
            the orbits and the movements of all the planets, taking into account their mutual
            actions" (at pp. 365–390).The peculiar dating is explained by a note printed on
            page 390 of the "Memoirs" section: "Even though the preceding memoirs, of Messrs.
            Clairaut and d'Alembert, were only read during the course of 1747, it was judged
            appropriate to publish them in the volume for this year" (i.e. the volume
            otherwise dedicated to the proceedings of 1745, but published in 1749).
